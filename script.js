/* LEVEL UP! (optional) 
	1. Function explanations: 
  function validateResult() checks whether the there's a blank space within the parameter ("Undefined") and return false if there is. The function returns true otherwise.

  function showResult() takes the calculated required square foot as parameter and put them in the function validateResult, which has 2 parameters to check if it is undefined or not. Then, it will convert the variable "result" into floating-point number and format it to 2 decimal places. 
  I'm not entirely sure that "_TESTING" does but it seems to assign the testing value to the result and return it to the user. 
  Finally, "document.getElementById("result").innerText = result;" updates the inner text of an element, presumably through HTML to display the formatted output.
  
	2. Custom styles added: 
 I changed the font size in #result to be responsive 
 font-size: 5vw;
